         <Typography style={{fontSize:20}} > One fundamental issue in todayâ€™s Online Social Networks (OSNs) is to give users the ability to control the messages posted on their own private space to avoid that unwanted content is displayed. Up to now, OSNs provide little support to this requirement. To fill the gap, in this paper, we propose a system allowing OSN users to have a direct control on the messages posted on their walls. This is achieved through a flexible rule-based system, which allows users to customize the filtering criteria to be applied to their walls, 
         and a Machine Learning-based soft classifier automatically labeling messages in support of content-based filtering  </Typography>
